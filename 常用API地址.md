1. What is Spring Boot Admin?
codecentric’s Spring Boot Admin is a community project to manage and monitor your Spring Boot ® applications. The applications register with our Spring Boot Admin Client (via HTTP) or are discovered using Spring Cloud ® (e.g. Eureka, Consul). The UI is just a Vue.js application on top of the Spring Boot Actuator endpoints.
